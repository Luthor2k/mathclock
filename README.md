# mathclock

Create a large 1-3 meter circle. Evenly places around the circle are 96 servos. Each servo has a laser diode on it with vertical plastic fresnel lens. Each min the servos will move and increase the times table by 1. The fractal will slowly change over time creating a new image every min. This project is based on this video “Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics” by “Mathologer” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8 An interactive animation tool can be found here http://entibo.fr/timesTables/
